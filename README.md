# ArielNikas-VEHeterogeneity
This project considers the effect of competing heterogeneities on vaccine effectiveness when protection is either constant or waning. The accompanying paper has been submitted to 'Clinical Infectious Diseases'. There are two main parts to the code:

1)Julia code for running each simulation, named for which Figure they produce a panel for. Please note that these example simulations will creat a two files each in your current working directory. To find your current working directory use the pwd() command in Julia.  We provide an example simulation result for the risk-correlate model (Figure 4). Julia files end in .jl 

2)R code runs the analysis and creates the corresponding figure or figure panel that it is named after.
